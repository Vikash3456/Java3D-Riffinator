🎸 JavaJam3D: A Pure Java 3D Render Engine 🚀

Welcome to JavaJam3D, where coding meets creativity in three dimensions! 🖼️

🌟 What is JavaJam3D?

JavaJam3D is a lightweight, pure Java 3D rendering engine crafted with love by a passionate B.Tech student. This project aims to bring the magic of 3D graphics to life using nothing but Java's built-in capabilities.

🔥 Key Features

- 💯 Pure Java: No external libraries or dependencies
- 🧊 Basic 3D primitive support (cubes, spheres, cylinders)
- 🌈 Simple shading and texture mapping
- 🎥 Customizable camera controls
- ⚡ Optimized for performance

🚀 Getting Started
